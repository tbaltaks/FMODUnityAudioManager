# FMOD-Unity Audio Manager

## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3+
- FMOD for Unity integration (install from https://www.fmod.com/unity or the Unity Asset Store) — the package expects the FMOD Unity integration to be installed in the project so the `FMODUnity` assembly is available. See FMOD docs for integration steps: (https://www.fmod.com/docs/)

## Installation
* In Unity: Window → Package Manager → Add package from gitURL → paste `https://github.com/tbaltaks/FMODUnityAudioManager`.
