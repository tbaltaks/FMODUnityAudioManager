# FMOD-Unity Audio Manager

## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3+
- FMOD for Unity integration (install from https://www.fmod.com/unity or the Unity Asset Store) — the package expects the FMOD Unity integration to be installed in the project so the `FMODUnity` assembly is available. See FMOD docs for integration steps: (https://www.fmod.com/docs/)

## Installation (local)
1. Copy the `fmodUnityAudioManager` folder into your project `Packages/` directory, or
2. In Unity: Window → Package Manager → Add package from disk → select `fmodUnityAudioManager/package.json`.
